a) What was the magnitude of this earthquake?
b) What are the coordinates of where the camera was likely located in order to record this scene?

All these links mention that this footage was of a city named Chisinau in Moldova. One news link mentioned of the camera being on a famous high rise. Therefore we seached Google images for famous high rise in Chisinau and found out that the video shows a famous shopping centre - Atrium shopping mall.

OSINT Exercise 026

Task Briefing - The image below shows the contents of a zip file. Inside you will find a 31-second video recorded during a train ride, and four photos of undisclosed locations. They were all taken by the same individual in February 2024. Despite having no useful metadata, they still contain enough information to track down this person’s movements.
Your task is to determine:

a) At which train stations did the person board and alight?

Bonus challenges -
a) Identify the mode of transportation in each image.
b) Determine the type of train they rode.
c) Estimate the speed at which the train was travelling when the footage was recorded.
d) Calculate approximately how far did the person travel overall.

Solution - We are given four photos and a video. On searching the first two photes using Google lens we get the location as Chorsu bazaar and Anhor lokomotiv in Tashkent, Uzbekistan respectively. Third image has many landmarks like 'Samsung Galaxy', 'Kapital Bank' and 'Navien'. After searching a lot for these three things being together at same place, we can finally see a place where 'Samsung Galaxy' and capital bank are together. After going through steet view it will take some time but we will reach the place in the image. This place is Afrosiab street. Fourth photo was difficult to find so we shifted to the video. The video is of a train because of the background noises and it captures a few landmarks. One of which can be identified as Hazora bus station in Samarkand. So we need to search for fourth photo in Samarkand. After going through the street view in Google maps along the main road from the Samarkand train station, we can finally locate the fourth image on Shah-i-zinda street in Samarkand. Therefore we can conclude that it is atrain from Tashkent to Samarkand. After searching for train from Tashkent to Samarkand we get a special high speed rail, Afrosiyob train which leaves from 'Stantsiya Tashkent Pass Tsentr' for Samarkand Train station.

For bonus questions, it is easy to conclude that first two photos are taken on foot. Third photo must have been taken from a car as it is taken from the middle of the road. Fourth photo was taken from car as car reflection is visible in the photo. They rode high speed rail - Afrosiyob train which travels at the speed of 250 km/hr. After adding up the distance from all the places identified in these images we get a total distance of 330 kms approximately.
