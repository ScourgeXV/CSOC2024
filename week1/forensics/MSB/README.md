MSB 

Description - This image passes LSB statistical analysis, but we can't help but think there must be something to the visual artifacts present in this image...

File - Ninja-and-Prince-Genji-Ukiyoe-Utagawa-Kunisada.flag.png

Solution - We are given a png image file. When we extract its most significant bits (hence MSB) online we get some text. After searching for pico we get our flag.

Flag - picoCTF{15_y0ur_que57_qu1x071c_0r_h3r01c_572ad5fe}
